# Project-2-List-Pagination
This is a web page that contains a list of student names, photos and email addresses;  display 10 names at a time, include a series of links at the bottom of the page to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.

It's all a matter of organizing the order of when elements and functionality need to be created and added to the DOM.
